# Altar Philosophy

## Introduction

Altar serves as both a documentation repository and a manual for users seeking to explore, customize, and expand TempleOS/ShrineOS into the operating systems of the future. Altar's philosophy is rooted in the belief that these operating systems can be a viable alternative to mainstream options like Pico-8 and certain Linux distributions. Altar aims to remove the religious aspects and bloat, focusing on simplicity and ease of customization.
